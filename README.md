# zerobase-python

## Welcome

Hey! Welcome to ZeroBase, a communications framework based on [ZeroMQ](https://zeromq.org/) for multiprocessing systems!

This is a Python package that provides a base class for building ZeroMQ-based programs for NanoStride. It handles all of the necessary setup and teardown for ZeroMQ, and provides a simple interface for sending and receiving messages. The library is designed to be easy to use and flexible, allowing you to quickly build and deploy ZeroMQ-based programs for a variety of use cases. 

With `zerobase`, you can focus on building the application logic, while the library takes care of the underlying ZeroMQ infrastructure.

That being said, it is still a work in progress, so don't hesitate to create an issue or start a PR!

Yours truly,
Augusto M.P
